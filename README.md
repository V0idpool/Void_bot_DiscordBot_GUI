## 📌 Notes  

- 💻 **This public release** provides a core set of features for a C# Discord Bot with a GUI and background task handling.
- ⚠️ **Setup Instructions**: 

You need to configure the settings first. Here’s what you need

- Your bot’s token.
- Your server ID.
- Youtube API Key and API name (For the /yt command example).
- Your MongoDB connection client URL and the name of your MongoDB cluster.

After that’s all set up, you can run the basic setup command using /setup to configure:
  
The Verification & Welcome Channel.
The rules channel.
The role to automatically give users after they successfully verify :check: .

 This saves the settings to MongoDB to get you started. 
 You can also check out the [Discord.Net Docs](https://docs.discordnet.dev/) or the code examples to customize other settings like XP cooldown value, XP gain amounts, etc.
 You could also manually edit the mongoDB entries in your ServerSettings schema if you want.

 Afterward, you’re ready to explore and customize further settings like XP cooldowns, gain amounts, and more.  
 Check out [Discord.Net Docs](https://docs.discordnet.dev/) or code examples for additional customization.

- ⚙️ **The settings file**: `UserCFG.ini` is saved in the same directory as the bot for easy access. Use it to manually edit your bot’s settings.

- ❤️ **Contributions and suggestions** from the community are welcome! Feel free to shape the future of VoidBot.
